# Time-Series

1. In this question, you are expected to perform regression over the dataset of global
active power values. You are supposed to take the active power values in the past
one hour and predict the next active power value.
2. Implement Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) as well as a linear regression model for
this question. You can find the data here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/
machine-learning-databases/00235/household_power_consumption.zip.
3. Compare and contrast the performance of both the models on metrics like Root
Mean Squared Error(RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) score and
any other metrics you feel may be useful.
4. It would be sufficient if you consider only the Global active power field.
5. You are allowed to use scikit-learn as well as deep learning frameworks such as
PyTorch, keras etc, for this purpose.
6. Experiment with different architectures(number of hidden layers, activation functions etc) and see the impact on performance. Summarize your findings in the
report.
7. Also experiment on taking some more window of past power values and report the
performance (For example taking a window of two hours instead of one).
